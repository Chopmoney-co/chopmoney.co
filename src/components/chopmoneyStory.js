                As a daring problem identified, people generally want to have
                more money aka become rich. Books on financial knowledge all say
                “Create a budget and stick to it” as if it’s that easy, we’ve
                realized the problem does not lie with the budget creation but
                rather the habit of sticking to it and that led us to Chopmoney.
                Just as mum or dad gave you your daily or weekly stipend that
                could not be exceeded, Chopmoney is a lifestyle mobile app that
                allows you to stick to your budget by sending you only the
                amount you have pre-selected every day. It is budgeting made
                better and free, so you can focus on what's important to you.
                With Chopmoney, you're in control of your spending and can take
